**Description/Answers:** This code solves a kinetics problem from the book using the forward Euler method.  It calculates these solutions and plots them. Answers to the questions in the homework are going to be put in this section.

a). From Example 7.12 in the book, a matrix was used to find the eigenvalues of the system of equations from the kinetics problem. This led to the first eigenvalue $\lambda being equal to -22. The other eigenvalues were equal to 0. This led to a bounding region where the k value had to be less than 1/17, so I chose the value to be 1/20 for this situation.

b). In practice, I started to see instability once the k value was equal to anything less than or equal to 1/12.
